                <p>
                    I was born here in Rexburg, Idaho, and I have lived here my entire life. I am the youngest in my
                    family, and growing up, I have always felt close to them. I have two older brothers, who are twins,
                    and a sister. My sister and I fought all the time, but she has always been there for me and has
                    always been my best friend. Being the youngest can be difficult — watching all my older siblings
                    grow up, get married, and move out sometimes made me feel alone. But I know that because of the
                    strong relationship we share, we will always have each other and always come back home. And besides,
                    one day I'll grow up, get married, and move out myself.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My two oldest brothers are both married. Cade, the
                    oldest, just had his second child — a daughter (this picture is a little outdated; she's not in it),
                    and they all live here in Rexburg. Levi, my second oldest brother, has three children: a daughter
                    and two sons, and they're expecting another son any day now. Levi and his family live in Kansas,
                    where Levi is going to KU. Finally, my sister Corinne was married a few years ago, and live here in
                    Rexburg.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now my major is Computer Science. Classes like
                    Web Development have really showed me how much I like to work on computers. This is my 7th semester,
                    but it's also my first time moving out of the house. It's been tough, but I'm excited to see what
                    this experience will bring me.
