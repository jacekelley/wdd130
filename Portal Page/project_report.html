                <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
                <p>I decided to use content and images that were familiar to me. I used some pictures I have taken for
                    myself, I used some pictures that I have seen online before, and I even used a screenshot of the
                    video
                    that first taught me how to solve a Rubik's Cube.</p>
                <h2> How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h2>
                <p>I mainly communicated with my developer through text. He had a lot of questions, and I was happy to
                    help
                    him. Since everything was mainly over text, we had a couple times when we didn't know what each
                    other
                    were saying, but overall, the communication went well.</p>
                <h2> Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
                <p>I started on my final project a bit before we talked about it in class, and I had a lot of fun things
                    planned for myself. When we learned that other people were going to do it for us, I was a little
                    bummed
                    because I was looking forward to some exciting things. But overall, this website looks a lot better
                    than
                    I anticipated. I am glad they made it work out well.</p>
                <h2> What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
                <p>I think the main thing I will do differently is look at the website more often, and have more to
                    suggest
                    for them to fix or change, if anything.</p>

                <h2> How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h2>
                <p>The main way I managed my development team was by messaging over our group chat to make sure that we
                    were all doing alright. I should have done better, seeing as one of the child pages still isn't
                    done, but overall, I just kept encouraging them and trying to help them.</p>
                <h2>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h2>
                <p>I actually sit by my client in class, so I talked to him in class sometimes, while also texting him.
                    There were a couple times that things didn't make sense in the site plan, but by talking to him, I
                    was able to understand it.</p>
                <h2>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h2>
                <p>I published my clients site very early one, and just added onto the code. As soon as I created the
                    repository, I shared the url with my client so they could see the progress and correct us if we
                    messed something up.</p>
                <h2>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h2>
                <p>It was a lot of fun. It was a little tricky to get used to, but once I did, I was easily to publish
                    things and make sure that the pages were updating and showing correctly.</p>

            <h2> What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h2>
            <p>I think that the most challenging part of this project was working with other people. Everyone is taking
                different classes, and it can be hard to coordinate. I was able to overcome it by being patient and
                trying to help others in any way I can.</p>
            <h2>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h2>
            <p>I really have enjoyed the coding. I love being able to create something just from code, and learn to make
                it better.</p>
            <h2>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h2>
            <p>If I were to do this project again, I would want to be better with communicating with my teammates. I
                mainly just did my own thing, which could have ended badly.</p>
            <h2>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h2>
            <p>I think that I do feel more confident working on real-world projects, yes. This project has taught me
                that doing your own part first can be beneficial, so you can help others with their parts and try to
                communicate better.</p>
